"Our" final project for Data Structure 2nd Semester. The project is a simple CRUD management loaning camera, lens and photographer.
The project is actually related with [graph_sby_map](https://github.com/Louis3112/graph_sby_map).

The project implements various of data structure concepts, such as :
1. Linked list (used to store and manage camera and lens data)           
2. Tree (used to store and manage member data)
3. Hash Table and Collision Handling (to manage camera and lens loans)
4. Stack (used to store and manage photographer data)
6. Graph (give tourist destination suggestions based on book that has been borrowed)

The project is developed using Functional programming, C++ language, runs on CLI, and only requires a minimal set of library to use (doesn't require installing any library from outside).

For further information, there is a [report](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18449868/DOKUMENTASI.PROGRAM.LAST.FINAL.PROJECT.docx)
